## 1. Research Question
Clearly state your final research question, ensuring it is well-defined and feasible within the scope of the project.

### Question

What factors in pet adoption listings influence adoption speed and success?

#### Other topics and questions of interest:
- Which pet profile attributes (e.g., breed, age, size, color, health status) are most predictive of faster adoption?
- Do certain breeds or pet types (dogs vs. cats) have a significantly higher or lower adoption rate?
- How do adoption rates vary by location, shelter type, or listing details?
"What role do pet descriptions and images play in influencing adoption likelihood?"
- Are there common characteristics among pets that remain listed for extended periods without adoption?
- What organizations or shelters have the highest adoption rates, and what factors contribute to their success?

## 2. Data Collection Methods (Ingestion Phase)
Identify the data sources you plan to use (e.g., API, web scraping, or openly available datasets) and provide links if available.

Describe how you will ingest the data into a storage solution, including any planned automation or scheduled tasks.

### Data Sources

#### APIs
- [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/)
- [Rescue Groups API](https://test1-api.rescuegroups.org/v5/public/docs)

#### Datasets
- [Sonoma county intake/outtake data](https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/Government/Animal-Shelter-Intake-and-Outcome/924a-vesw/data_preview) (Also has an API)

### Data Ingestion

I plan to create a DB through Supabase and create several edge functions that will run on a schedule to fetch data from the listed API.

These functions will do one of the following to the provided APIs:
- Fetch most up to date pets that have been adopted.
- Fetch pets that are still listed as adoptable after 60 days of lambda invocation.

For the datasets, I plan to run functions locally once to transform and inject into the DB.

#### Why am I choosing Supabase?

- They have a free tier.
- Out of the box, the DB you create will generate an API for you.
- They have support for scheduling edge functions which will be needed to fetch data.

**Note**: I wanted to create this project using AWS for scalability and practice creating and managing an RDS instance, but Supabase will handle the data serving part out of the box.

## 3. Data Transformation Process
Outline how you will structure and normalize the raw data into a database schema (preferably in third normal form (3NF)).

Explain how you will clean, preprocess, and transform the data for later analysis.

### Database Schema

#### Animals

Stores general information about the animals.

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | BIGINT | PRIMARY KEY | Unique ID for each animal |
| `name` | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL | Animalâ€™s name |
| `age` | ENUM | NOT NULL | kitten, adult, senior, unknown |
| `species` | ENUM | NOT NULL | dog, cat |
| `breed` | VARCHAR(100) | UNIQUE | Breed name (e.g., Rottweiler) |
| `sex` | VARCHAR(10) | NOT NULL | Male/Female |
| `size` | ENUM | NOT NULL | small, medium, large |
| `description` | TEXT | NULL | Animal description |
| `status` | ENUM | NOT NULL | available, adopted, pending |
| `organization_id` | VARCHAR(50) | FOREIGN KEY | References `organizations.id` |
| `posting_img_count` | SMALLINT | NULL | The count of the images in the posting |

#### Attributes

Stores various attributes of animals.

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `animal_id` | BIGINT | FOREIGN KEY | References `animals.id` |
| `spayed_neutered` | BOOLEAN | NULL | Whether the pet is sterilized |
| `house_trained` | BOOLEAN | NULL | House trained or not |
| `declawed` | BOOLEAN | NULL | Only relevant for cats |
| `special_needs` | BOOLEAN | NULL | Special needs flag |
| `shots_current` | BOOLEAN | NULL | Whether vaccinations are current |

#### Environment

Stores compatibility of an animal with other pets and children.

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `animal_id` | BIGINT | FOREIGN KEY | References `animals.id` |
| `dogs_ok` | BOOLEAN | NULL | Whether the pet is good with dogs |
| `cats_ok` | BOOLEAN | NULL | Whether the pet is good with cats |
| `kids_ok` | BOOLEAN | NULL | Whether the pet is good with children |

#### Organizations

Stores information about the organizations managing adoptions.

| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | VARCHAR(50) | PRIMARY KEY | Unique organization ID |
| `name` | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL | Organization name |
| `city` | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL | Operating city |
| `state` | VARCHAR(50) | NOT NULL | Operating state |

### Data Transformation

Notes about data transformation:
- Missing values will be inserted with `NULL`.
- Responses from the API will be transformed into the appropriate data types.
- Data will be processed through separate scheduled functions.
- Dataset will be processed one time on my local machine.

## 4. Data Serving and Querying
Mention any plans to expose data through an API, dashboard, or other means if applicable.

I plan to expose the data through an API generated from Supabase.
